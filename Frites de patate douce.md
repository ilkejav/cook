#Frites de patate douce
###Ingrédients
- 2 large sweet potatoes, peeled (or unpeeled, if you like skin) and cut into wedges
- 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

###Préparation
- Preheat oven to 450 degrees (F). Line a large baking sheet with tinfoil (shiny side up); place baking rack onto prepared baking sheet; set aside.
- Peel the sweet potatoes (if preferred) and cut off the pointy ends. Slice the sweet potatoes in half (lengthwise), then cut each piece into wedges.
- Place the sweet potato wedges in a large bowl, then add in the olive oil, salt, sugar, seasoning, and black pepper. Mix well, making sure each wedge is coated with oil and spices.
- Arrange the sweet potato wedges in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 30 minutes, then turn on the broiler and bake for another 3-5 minutes, or until they're well browned and crispy. Keep an eye here - it's easy to burn when the broiler is on!
- Cool wedges on pan for 5 minutes, then serve at once!
